# Netflix-Comedy-Show-Recommendation-System
Introduction:  This project involves an end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA) and developing a machine-learning recommendation system for Netflix comedy shows. Using a dataset of Netflix titles, the project aims to provide personalized recommendations for users based on content similarity, helping them discover shows tailored to their interests.


**Goal:**

   To analyze Netflix comedy shows, uncover patterns in their attributes, and build a content-based 
   recommendation system to suggest similar shows for enhanced viewer engagement.

**Description:**
  The project utilizes influencer marketing data to:

  - **Filter and Preprocess Data:** Extract comedy shows, handle missing values, and engineer features for 
       content analysis.
  - **Explore Comedy Trends:** Analyze the distribution of comedy shows over time and common themes or genres.
  - **Build Recommendation System:** Train a content-based recommendation system using TF-IDF vectorization 
       and cosine similarity.
  - **Evaluate Recommendations:** Validate the effectiveness of the recommendations based on similarity scores.
     
**Skills:**

  - **Data Analysis:** Python (Pandas, NumPy)
  - **Recommendation System:** TF-IDF Vectorization, Cosine Similarity
  - **Data Visualization:** Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
  - **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook for EDA, analysis, and model development

**Metrics:**

  - **Show Distribution:** Analysis of the frequency of comedy shows by release year and genres.
  - **Recommendation Effectiveness:** Cosine similarity scores are used to rank recommended shows.
  - **Text Analysis:** TF-IDF-based feature extraction from show descriptions, cast, and genres.

    
**Summary:**

  The analysis revealed trends in Netflix comedy shows, including their release patterns and dominant themes. 
  The content-based recommendation system successfully suggests shows similar to a user's preference, 
  leveraging text data from descriptions and genres. This project demonstrates how data analysis and machine 
  learning can enhance user experience on streaming platforms by enabling personalized content discovery.
